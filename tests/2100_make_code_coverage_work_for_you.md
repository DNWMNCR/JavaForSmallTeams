## Make code coverage work for you

Coverage is a tool that should work for you. You do not work for the tool.

Use code coverage to highlight your mistakes - run it regularly so that it highlights code that has definitely not been tested.

100% of code that it makes sense to unit test should be unit tested - if the coverage tool highlights untested code either delete the code, add a test, or make sure you are confident that this is code that does not require a unit test.
