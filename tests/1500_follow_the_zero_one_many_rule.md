## Follow the Zero, One and Many rule

If your unit must deal with numbers, make sure you create sufficient test cases. A good rule thumb is that test cases covering 0, 1 and more than 1 are likely to be necessary. Edges cases that you might well also want to consider for algorithmic code are `Integer.MAX` and `Integer.MIN` etc.

Many common types have similar edge case values e.g empty `Strings` and `Collections`.

It likely that there will also be domain specific and type specific values that are also important to cover.
