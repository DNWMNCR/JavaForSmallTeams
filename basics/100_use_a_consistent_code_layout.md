## Use a consistent code layout within each project

The way in which Java code is formatted and laid out is largely a matter of personal preference.

Some styles (such as omitting braces in conditional statements) can arguably make certain types of bug slightly more likely, or require more work to keep the code compliant (such aligning fields into columns), but to a first approximation no particular scheme is greatly superior to any other. Despite this programmers tend to have strong opinions on the matter.

Every codebase should however have a single agreed formatting style which is consistently applied. This should be communicated to and understood by everyone working on that codebase.

For teams that do not have their own strong preferences, the following layout guidelines are suggested. They are described only briefly here, the attached eclipse settings file provides more detail. 

### Suggested formatting rules

```java
class Example {
  int[] myArray = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
  int theInt = 1;
  String someString = "Hello";
  double aDouble = 3.0;

  void foo(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e, int f) {
    if (f == 5) {
      System.out.println("fnord");
    } else {
      System.out.println(someString);
    }

    switch (a) {
    case 0:
      Other.doFoo();
      break;
    default:
      Other.doBaz();
    }
  }

  void bar(List v) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      v.add(new Integer(i));
    }
  }
}
```

#### Spaces not tabs

Tabs may appear differently depending on how an editor is configured. This may result in constant reformatting of the code by different programmers to adapt the file to their editor settings. Spaces avoid this problem.

In some languages (e.g JavaScript before the rise of code minifiers) tabs have/had an advantage as they reduced the size of the source file compared to using multiple spaces. The increase in size of the source file is of no relevance for Java.

#### One true brace style

There are various arguments about the supposed advantages of this style, but we suggest its use mainly because it is common in the Java community.

Although simple if else statements can be more concisely written by omitting the braces we suggest that they are always included as this reduces the chance of a statement being placed outside the conditional when this was not the intent.
