## Methods should be simple

As well as being small, methods should be simple. A few lines of terse highly concentrated logic is harder to read than the same logic spread over a larger number of lines.

The complexity of a method can be measured using `Cyclomatic complexity`. As a guide methods should normally have a complexity below 5. This is a guide only, not a hard rule.
