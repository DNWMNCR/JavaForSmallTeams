## Remember YAGNI

You're not going to need it.

Write the code you need now, not the code you *think* you will need in the future.

You're goal is to write the minimum amount of functionality that will solve the problem you have now.

Creating more than the minimum means you have more code to debug, understand and maintain from that point forward until someone has the confidence to delete it.
